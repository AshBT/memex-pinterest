Introduction
=============

Welcome! If you're reading this, then you're interested in trying out or 
using Team Hyperion Gray's SourcePin application (formerly Sourcefinder).

SourcePin is a simple application built to allow you to crawl and index
websites of interest and provide them to 
you in an intuitive manner. It is meant to allow for quick, semi-automated decision making on the content 
of websites by providing website screenshots via a Pinterest-like UI and 
an extensible scoring API.

It was first applied as a way to reliably find online escort ads, but can be extended
to any concept. This application is still in heavy development and should be
considered alpha-level software.
